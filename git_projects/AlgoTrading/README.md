# AlgoTrading
Taking a crack at automated day trading.

Will focus initially on using Reinforcement Learning to train the agent on trading. As I learn more about trading strategies in general, I will move towards a hybrid approach. This is all very new to me (stocks and trading), but I wanted to try and apply my relevant skills and learn more about RL along the way.
<br><br>
**Update:** Put the RL approach on the backburner for now. Actually, I'm going to start with non-machine learning approaches, before seeing how I can benefit from applying machine learning correctly.

**Second Update:** Realized I know nothing about how the market or trading works. Reading books, compiling resources and trying my hand at it manually first.
<br> Will revisit algo trading when I have a basis to build from. First try still served it's purpose!
